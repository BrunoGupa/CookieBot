# CookieBot

This cookie bot eats cookies from http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/. We use a greedy algorithm that buys items over exponentially growing time intervals achieving 118.4 cookies per second at the end of 5 minutes threshold. 

## Task List
- [x] Create an exponential growth function.
- [ ] Compare the score with different functions.
- [ ] Create a Machine Learning algorithm to optimize the buy time and the selection of the items.
